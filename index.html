<h2 id="what-is-roblox-fps-unlocker">What is ROBLOX FPS UNLOCKER?</h2>
In the Roblox game, the game environment doesn’t permit you to remove the 60 FPS limit. To address this, a game engineer built up an FPS Unlocker. The Roblox FPS Unlocker was openly delivered on GitHub, and clients will presently have endless FPS with this program. The application isn’t a hack or a cheat; everything it does is handicap the casing limiter and v-sync, the two of which are permitted by default.

When v-sync is enabled, the frames are limited to 60. Similarly, if the PC generates more than 100 FPS, V-Sync will reduce the FPS to 60, which may create significant performance problems.

Every player wants to upgrade his game to a higher framerate. But the original game application does not have such a setting where you can freely just jump to a higher version of it. Even if you are willing to upgrade your framerate to a better version than you have right now, you will require a third-party tool to do so.
